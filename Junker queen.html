            Junker Queen is a Tank hero in Overwatch. As the fierce leader of the Junkers, she brings chaos and destruction to the battlefield. Junker Queen wields a <b>Scattergun</b>, a pump-action shotgun which deals spread damage to enemies, useful in close-range battles. <!-- Paragraph describing Junker Queen and her weapon -->

        </p>

        <p>

            In addition to her Scattergun, Junker Queen has various other abilities. Her <b>Jagged Blade</b>, which she uses as a throwing knife, deals damage to enemies and inflicts wound damage, causing damage over time. She also has another ability called <b>Commanding Shout</b>, where she gains and grants temporary health and speed to herself and her allies by shouting. She even has an ability called <b>Carnage</b> where she wields an axe that can damage multiple enemies by swinging it at close range. This axe also deals wound damage. <!-- Paragraph describing Junker Queen's abilities -->

        </p>

        <p>

            Her ultimate ability <b>Rampage</b> allows her to charge forward, damaging enemies and inflicting wound damage over time, while also preventing them from being healed for a short duration. She is one of the few tank heroes to have a passive ability called <b>Adrenaline Rush</b> where Junker Queen heals from the wound damage dealt to enemies. <!-- Paragraph describing Junker Queen's ultimate ability and passive ability -->
