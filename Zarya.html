        <!-- Description of Zarya -->
        <b>Zarya</b> is a tank that heavily focuses on defensive abilities. Her primary weapon <b>Particle Cannon</b> is a short-ranged linear beam weapon that can damage enemies.

        <p>
            <!-- Description of Zarya's abilities -->
            Zarya's abilities include <b>Particle Barrier</b>, where she deploys a barrier to protect herself from incoming damage and increases the damage dealt using her passive ability. Her other shield ability is <b>Projected Barrier</b>, where Zarya uses her barrier to protect allies. This ability also works the same way as her Particle Barrier, where damage received makes the damage output of her Particle Cannon higher.
        </p>
        <p>
            <!-- Description of Zarya's ultimate ability -->
            Zarya's ultimate ability is <b>Graviton Surge</b>, where she deploys a gravity well that pulls enemies towards it and prevents them from using their abilities while being pulled.
