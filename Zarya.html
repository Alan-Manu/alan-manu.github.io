        <b>Zarya</b> is a tank that heavily focuses on defensive abilites. Her primary weapon <b>Particle Cannon</b> is a short ranged linear beam weapon that can damage enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Zarya's abilities include <b>Particle Barrier</b>, where she deploys a barrier she protects herself from incoming damage and increases the damge dealt using her passive. Her other shield ability<b>Projected Barrier</b>, zarya uses her barrier to protect allies, this also works the same way as her particle barrier where damage received makes the damage output of her particle cannon higher
        </p>
        <p>
            Zarya's ultimate <b>Graviton Surge</b>, zarya deploys a gravity well that pulls enemies towards it and makes it so that they cant use their abilities while being pulled.
