            <b>Reinhardt</b> is a stalwart Tank hero in Overwatch 2. He is a formidable presence on the battlefield, protecting his teammates and leading the charge. Reinhardt's primary weapon <b>Rocket Hammer</b> is a rocket-powered hammer that is swung by Reinhardt and deals damage at close range to enemies.
        </p> <!-- Paragraph describing Reinhardt and his primary weapon -->
        <p>
            Reinhardt's abilities include <b>Charge</b>, where Reinhardt charges forward. If an enemy is caught while he is going forward, they are killed if Reinhardt smashes into a wall. His other ability <b>Fire Strike</b> creates a fiery projectile that damages enemies from afar if hit by it.
        </p> <!-- Paragraph describing Reinhardt's abilities -->
        <p>
            Another ability is <b>Barrier Field</b>, which creates an energy shield blocking incoming attacks and helps his team to push enemies.
        </p> <!-- Paragraph describing another ability of Reinhardt -->
        <p>
            Reinhardt's ultimate ability, <b>Earthshatter</b>, uses Reinhardt's rocket hammer to hit the ground and deal splash damage. If enemies are within the splash area, they are stunned for a short duration, enabling Reinhardt to deal damage or kill the enemy.
